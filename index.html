          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Henry Nguyen, real name Hung Nguyen Huy. I was born and
            raised in Hanoi, Vietnam for the majority of my life. I came to the
            US for the first time in 2017 and have been studying here since.
            Yeah I know that's quite a long time for an International Student,
            but what can you do. I certainly can't do anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently a Junior/Senior student at UC trying to fight my way
            towards a degree in Computer Engineering. Now I don't know about
            anyone else, but I find all this studying to be really annoying and
            time-consuming and I'm just tired honestly. Not to mention this CE
            thing is hard. And jobs are going away. So is the American Dream. So
            is my mind. And so is my attention span which is being used to write
            these introduction. What?
          </p>
          <p>
            I really like playing games &#127918; and listening to &#127925; to
            the point where I can go for hours without getting bored. I did have
            a time where I pondered the possibility of starting streaming just
            so I have something "productive" to do while gaming. But being Asian
            that obviously was not going to fly. So here I am at UC pursuing
            something that my parents thought was popular. Computer Science is
            popular but I chose Computer Engineering because I thought I could
            study both CS and Engineering. That was a massive mistake on my
            part.

          <h2>Interesting fact</h2>
          <p>Here are some interesting facts about me:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Since I've been in the States for over 7 years, I'm actually
              qualified as a Resident Alien for tax purposes. This makes filing
              for taxes every year kinda troublesome &#127775;
            </li>
            <li>
              When I first came to the US, I stayed with a Vietnamese host
              family in Muskegon, MI. One time we went to a waterpark (which I
              can't remember the name of), they left me behind for 2~3 hours and
              went home by themselves. Just another traumatic thing to add to my
              list for the usual therapy session.
            </li>
            <li>
              Did I mention I don't exactly fit the bill of the typical Asian? I
              don't have stellar grades, I'm not a Business Bro, I'm not Korean,
              and I'm not human. Wait no that last one was correct. Not an Asian
              stereotype. I did have a time where I didn't get along with my
              parents though so that's another.
